### <PROJECT> Best Practices Application
Apply proven patterns from successful executive presentations including investment framing, risk matrices, and phased roadmaps.

## OPTIMIZATION DIMENSIONS

### 1. Narrative Flow (Story Arc)

Every executive presentation must follow this proven structure:

**Hook (Slide 1-2)**: Why should executives care?
- Quantified business pain or opportunity
- Market/competitive context
- "Cost of doing nothing" framing

**Context (Slide 3)**: Current situation
- Where we are today
- How we got here
- Why status quo isn't sustainable

**Problem (Slide 4-5)**: What's broken/missing
- Specific pain points with metrics
- Business impact (revenue, efficiency, risk)
- Gaps in current capabilities

**Solution (Slide 6-8)**: Recommended approach
- High-level architecture (business flow, not tech details)
- How it addresses each pain point
- Key differentiators

**Evidence (Slide 9-10)**: Why this will work
- Success patterns from similar projects
- ROI model with conservative assumptions
- Proof points (benchmarks, case studies)

**Investment (Slide 11)**: What's needed
- Budget with breakdown
- Timeline with phases
- Resource requirements
- Frame as investment vs expense

**Action (Slide 12)**: What to decide now
- Clear recommendation
- Decision needed today
- Next steps with owners
- Timeline for decision

### 2. Slide Structure Rules

**One Key Message Per Slide**
- Slide title = the takeaway, not the topic
- Example: "Integration delays cost £250K annually" (not "Current Integration Challenges")

**3-Bullet Rule**
- Maximum 3 main points per slide
- Maximum 8 words per bullet
- Sub-bullets only when absolutely necessary

**Visual > Text**
- Aim for 60% visual, 40% text ratio
- Use charts instead of data tables
- Use diagrams instead of text descriptions
- Use icons to reinforce concepts

**No "Wall of Text" Slides**
- Maximum 50 words per slide
- If it needs more words, split into multiple slides
- Use speaker notes for details, not slide content

**Progressive Disclosure**
- Start with summary, details in appendix
- Each slide builds on previous
- Complex topics broken into simple steps

### 3. Business Framing Principles

**Lead with Business Outcomes**
- Revenue impact (growth, retention, new markets)
- Efficiency gains (time saved, cost reduced)
- Risk mitigation (compliance, security, resilience)

**Technical Details as Evidence**
- Architecture shown as business capability map
- Technology choices justified by business needs
- Integration complexity translated to business risk

**ROI Quantified**
- Specific numbers, not "significant improvement"
- Conservative assumptions documented
- Payback period highlighted
- 3-year value projection

**Risk of Inaction**
- Cost of doing nothing quantified
- Competitive disadvantage highlighted
- Compliance/regulatory exposure shown
- Technical debt impact calculated

**Executive-Level Language**
- Avoid: "API integration," "microservices," "data pipeline"
- Use: "Automated data flow," "flexible architecture," "real-time insights"
- Technical terms only when they add business clarity

### 4. Visual Hierarchy Standards

**Most Important Info First**
- Top-left quadrant = primary message
- Size indicates importance
- Color draws attention to key points

**Emphasis Through Design**
- Bold for critical statements
- Color for highlight (sparingly)
- Boxes/borders for key callouts
- Icons for category identification

**White Space for Readability**
- Minimum 20% white space per slide
- Breathing room around text blocks
- Clear separation between sections

**Consistent Formatting**
- Same colors for same concepts throughout
- Consistent icon style
- Aligned elements (not scattered)
- Uniform spacing

## BEFORE/AFTER OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK

For each slide being optimized, provide:

### Current Issues
```
❌ Problems with current slide:
- Wall of text (150 words vs 50 word max)
- Title is topic, not takeaway ("Integration Architecture" vs "Automated Integration Eliminates £250K Manual Work")
- No visual elements (100% text)
- Technical jargon without business context
- No clear "so what?" for executives
```

### Optimization Plan
```
✓ Improvements to apply:
1. Rewrite title as business outcome
2. Reduce content to 3 key bullets (8 words max each)
3. Add visual: Integration flow diagram
4. Translate tech terms to business language
5. Add ROI callout box
6. Move technical details to speaker notes
```

```

## OPTIMIZATION RULES (QUALITY GATES)

### Rule 1: The "So What?" Test
Every slide must answer: "So what? Why should I care?"
```
❌ FAILS: "New CRM Integration Architecture"
✓ PASSES: "CRM Integration Eliminates 15 Hours of Weekly Manual Work"

Test: If you removed the slide, would executives miss a key decision factor?
```

### Rule 2: The 50-Word Limit
No slide should exceed 50 words of body content.
```
❌ FAILS: 150-word paragraph explaining technical approach
✓ PASSES: 3 bullets × 8 words each = 24 words total

Exception: Executive Summary slide can have up to 100 words
```

### Rule 3: The Numbers Rule
Use specific numbers, never vague qualifiers.
```
❌ AVOID: "significant improvement," "many users," "faster performance"
✓ USE: "£250K annual savings," "4,500 users," "60% faster processing"

Every claim must be quantified or removed
```

### Rule 4: The Visual Balance Rule
Aim for 60% visual, 40% text ratio.
```
Assessment:
- Count words on slide
- Estimate visual space (charts, diagrams, images, white space)
- If text dominates (>60%), add visual or split slide

Visual types:
✓ Charts for data
✓ Diagrams for processes
✓ Icons for concepts
✓ Images for context
```

### Rule 5: The First-3-Slides Hook
Slides 1-3 must hook executives or you've lost them.
```
Slide 1: Title with value tagline
Slide 2: Executive summary (why care, what's being asked)
Slide 3: The quantified problem (cost of inaction)

If they're not engaged by slide 3, they're mentally checked out
```

### Rule 6: The Takeaway-Title Rule
Every slide title must be the takeaway, not the topic.
```
❌ Topic Title: "Market Analysis"
✓ Takeaway Title: "Market Growing 40% YoY Creates £10M Opportunity"

❌ Topic Title: "Risk Assessment"
✓ Takeaway Title: "All High Risks Mitigated with Proven Strategies"

Test: Can someone understand value by reading titles only?
```

### Rule 7: The Appendix Rule
Technical deep-dives never belong in main deck.
```
Main Deck: Business-level view (what, why, value)
Appendix: Technical details (how, architecture, specs)

Move to appendix:
- Detailed technical architecture
- Complete risk registers
- Full financial models
- Implementation specs
- Vendor comparisons
```

### Rule 8: The Clear-CTA Rule
Last slide must have ONE clear call-to-action.
```
❌ VAGUE: "Please consider this proposal and let us know"
✓ CLEAR: "Approve £400K Phase 1 funding by December 15"

Must include:
- Specific ask
- Owner of decision
- Deadline
- Consequence of delay
```
