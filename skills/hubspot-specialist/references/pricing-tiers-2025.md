2. Data remains but may become inaccessible
3. Workflows may pause
4. Reports may break
5. Custom objects become read-only

**Recommendation:** Export critical data and document configurations before downgrading.

## Upgrade Path

**Recommended progression:**
1. Free → Starter (validate fit)
2. Starter → Professional (when automation needed)
3. Professional → Enterprise (when scaling or need advanced features)

**Typical triggers for upgrade:**
- Free to Starter: Need to remove branding, basic automation
- Starter to Professional: Need workflows, ABM, custom reporting
- Professional to Enterprise: Need custom objects, predictive AI, conversation intelligence
