# Prompt Cache Audit Skill

**Trigger:** `/cache-audit` or "audit my caching" or "check my cache setup" or "am I breaking the cache?"

**What it does:** Reads your live Claude Code configuration and checks it against the 6 prompt caching rules from Anthropic's engineering team. Returns a scored report with specific, actionable fixes.

**Reference:** Based on Thariq Shihipar's thread "Lessons from Building Claude Code: Prompt Caching Is Everything"

## When Invoked

Run all checks automatically. Do not ask for confirmation. Read the relevant files and produce the full report in one pass.

## The 6 Checks

### Check 1 — Prompt Ordering (Static Before Dynamic)

**Read:** `~/.claude/settings.json`, all active `CLAUDE.md` files in the project hierarchy

**What to look for:**
- Does the system prompt load in the right order? Rule: static content first, dynamic content last
- Correct order: System prompt -> Tools -> CLAUDE.md -> Session context -> Messages
- Flag: Any dynamic content (timestamps, git status, current date, user stats) appearing in the system prompt itself
- Flag: CLAUDE.md files that include session-specific or time-sensitive data
- Pass: CLAUDE.md files that are purely static instructions, conventions, and file references

**Scoring:**
- PASS: System prompt is fully static, dynamic data injected via messages
- WARNING: Some dynamic data in system prompt but low-frequency change
- FAIL: High-churn dynamic content (timestamps, file contents) in system prompt

---

### Check 2 — Dynamic Updates via Messages (not System Prompt Edits)

**Read:** All hook files listed under `SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit` in `~/.claude/settings.json`

**What to look for:**
- Hooks should output dynamic data as `additionalContext` in their JSON response (which becomes a `<system-reminder>` message) — not by modifying the system prompt
- Check each hook's output format: does it use `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`?
- Flag: Any hook that writes to a system prompt file, modifies CLAUDE.md, or injects into the static prefix
- Pass: Hooks that return JSON with `additionalContext` key

**Also check:**
- Is `currentDate` injected via message (memory.md context) or hardcoded in system prompt?
- Is git status coming from a hook -> message, or somewhere static?

**Scoring:**
- PASS: All hooks use additionalContext pattern
- FAIL: Any hook modifies system prompt or CLAUDE.md mid-session

---

### Check 3 — Tool Set Stability (No Add/Remove Mid-Session)

**Read:** `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/skills/*.md`, MCP server configurations

**What to look for:**
- Tools should be identical at every turn of the conversation
- Check: Do any skills explicitly add new tools when invoked?
- Check: Are MCP tools using deferred loading stubs rather than full schemas loaded conditionally?
- Flag: Any skill that modifies the available tool set
- Pass: MCP tools present as lightweight stubs in every request, full schemas only loaded on demand via ToolSearch

**Scoring:**
- PASS: Tool set is fixed at session start, all MCP tools deferred
- WARNING: Some conditional tool loading that may cause cache misses
- FAIL: Skills or hooks that add/remove tools mid-conversation

---

### Check 4 — No Mid-Session Model Switches

**Read:** `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/skills/*.md`, any agent/team configurations

**What to look for:**
- The `model` field in settings.json should be set and stable
- Check: Do any skills switch models in the same conversation thread?
- Pass: Model switches are done via subagents with handoff messages — separate conversations, not inline switches
- Flag: Any pattern where the main conversation calls a different model mid-turn

**Scoring:**
- PASS: Single model per conversation, subagents used for model delegation
- FAIL: Inline model switching in same conversation thread

---

### Check 5 — Dynamic Content Size

**Read:** Hook files, git status injection, session-reminder outputs

**What to measure:**
- Estimate the size of dynamic content injected per session/turn
- Check the git status hook output size
- Check SessionStart hooks and their combined output

**Thresholds:**
- < 2k chars injected per turn: PASS
- 2k-10k chars: WARNING (correct pattern, just expensive)
- > 10k chars: FLAG — consider trimming

**Known issue:** Git status with hundreds of untracked files can exceed 40k chars per session start. Recommend: trim to branch name + changed file count + modified file list only.

---

### Check 6 — Fork Safety (Compaction & Subagent Calls)

**Read:** Any compaction configuration, skill invocations that fork context

**What to look for:**
- When Claude Code runs compaction, does the summary request reuse the same system prompt + tools as the parent?
- When skills fork a subagent, do they pass through the same prefix?
- Claude Code handles this correctly by default

**Scoring:**
- PASS: Using Claude Code's built-in compaction (handled correctly)
- MANUAL CHECK: Custom compaction or summarization flows

---

## Output Format

After running all checks, output this report:

```
PROMPT CACHE AUDIT

Score: X/6

[status]  Rule 1 — Ordering: [PASS/WARNING/FAIL]

[status]  Rule 2 — Message injection: [PASS/WARNING/FAIL]
   -> [Hooks checked and their pattern]

[status]  Rule 3 — Tool stability: [PASS/WARNING/FAIL]
   -> [MCP tool count, defer status]

[status]  Rule 4 — Model switching: [PASS/WARNING/FAIL]
   -> [Model in settings, any inline switches]

[status]  Rule 5 — Dynamic content size: [PASS/WARNING/FAIL]
   -> [Estimated chars/turn for each injection point]

[status]  Rule 6 — Fork safety: [PASS/MANUAL CHECK]
   -> [Compaction pattern used]

## Quick Reference: The 6 Rules

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|-------|
| 1. Ordering | Static system prompt -> CLAUDE.md -> messages | Dynamic data in system prompt |
| 2. Updates | Inject via `<system-reminder>` in messages | Edit system prompt mid-session |
| 3. Tools | Fixed tool set + deferred stubs | Add/remove tools per turn |
| 4. Models | One model per conversation, subagents for switches | Inline model switching |
| 5. Size | Trim dynamic injections to minimum needed | Dump full git status (40k chars) |
| 6. Forks | Same prefix for compaction/subagents | Different system prompt for summary calls |
