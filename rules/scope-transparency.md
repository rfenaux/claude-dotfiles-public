# Scope Transparency

When reporting deliverables or project status:

- **Categorize work**: In-Scope (contracted) | Out-of-Scope Delivered (goodwill) | Remaining
- **Quantify goodwill**: Attach estimated value ("9 CPQ workflows = $X value")
- **Lead with overage**: If scope exceeded, state it early with percentage

When starting work:

- Clarify scope exclusions explicitly ("ignoring archived/ directory")
- Confirm boundaries when context is critical
- When scope creep detected -> `/deviate scope` (links to deviation-handling rule)
